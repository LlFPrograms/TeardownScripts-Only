# Actual Functions DOCUMENTATION
This is the documentation for each of the functions in this folder. Maybe, I'll add a Wiki for everything.

## BetterPrint (BetterPrint-ForTeardown_1.0.lua)
What is does is just like the default DebugPrint but you can pass an infinite amount of arguments, and everytime there's a new argument, it adds a space between them (my example is: Instead of DebugPrint("hello " .. val .. " world!"), you can do this: BetterPrint("hello", val, "world!")).

To clarify, you can just do BetterPrint("My value is equals to", myValue).
You can also do this: BetterPrint(myValue, myOtherValue, myStringValue).
